# Local Chat App ðŸš€

A simple real-time web chat application built with Node.js, Socket.IO, and Vite.
This project is designed for **local network usage**, so all users must be connected to the same Wi-Fi to interact.

**After running the quick setup**, you can copy the link provided and open it in your favorite browser. 
Share this link with friends or family connected to your home Wi-Fi to start chatting.

The app works on any device, but make sure your machine is running the app first, as it acts as the local server for everyone else.

## Features

- Real-time chat between multiple users on the same local network.
- **Delete button**: clears the chat for all users (both client and server messages). 
- Automatic setup of environment variables.
- Easy start with a single setup script.
- ASCII art branding with dynamic creation and last updated timestamps.

# Follow this steps : 
## Install Node.js, npm & nodemon on your local machine

ðŸ”— App running on:
http://your-local-ip:5173/

âš  Attention: The chat works only for devices on your local Wi-Fi.
Share the URL to let them connect.
Copy the URL shown under App running on: and open it on any device connected to the same Wi-Fi to start chatting.
```
### Script Behavior
Press CTRL+C to safely stop servers and free occupied ports.

The setup script automatically detects missing dependencies and installs them.

.env stores your local IP to allow frontend connection from other devices.
